          <p>In 2011 I was diagnosed with celiac disease. After that with my husband we first had closely examine all the ingredients we use for cooking. At the very beginning we had to thoroughly read the labels of ALL food and drink we bought. A simple shopping became a 4 hours long exercise which resulted in not more than 10-15 items in the basket. Gluten was everywhere. We have found it even in the least anticipated places, like in some spices or pickles which we used to ate on a daily bases. This was terrifying. We thought we are not going to be able to cook more than just a few type of dishes.</p>

          <p>The selection of gluten free product at that time wasn’t wide. Once we have managed to find a few suitable ingredients, experimentation started. With patience and persistence we increased the number of dishes we can cook and now, couple of years later there are only a few dishes what I still cannot cook gluten free. Right from the start we agreed that we won’t be cooking gluten free for myself and non-gluten free for my husband, just one dish for both of us.</p>

          <p>I decided to writing down the recipes and sometimes filming the process too. This meant anyone can cook with those instructions and there is now an ever growing list of dishes we can choose from. Then we noticed that more and more of our friends and acquaintances got diagnosed with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. We felt we could help them by sharing our recipes which were result of experimentation over years. I think these are very helpful even though that both the selection of ingredients and the awareness is much wider nowadays. I try to share my tips and tricks how to make life whole without gluten.
