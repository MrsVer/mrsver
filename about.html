            <p>Mostly gluten free is my chosen lifestyle. Back in 2011 my wife was diagnosed with celiac disease. Right after that we had to kick off a lifetime of a research project. One in which we first had closely examine all the ingredients we use for cooking. At the very beginning we had to thoroughly read the labels of ALL food and drink we bought. As a side effect we had made quite a few discoveries, like the surprisingly low percentage of meat in some processed meat products (like frankfurters, hams). Previously we thought these contain mostly meat. A simple shopping became a 4 hours long exercise which resulted in not more than 10-15 items in the basket. Gluten was everywhere. We have found it even in the least anticipated places, like in some spices or pickles which we used to ate on a daily bases. This was terrifying. We thought we are not going to be able to cook more than just a few type of dishes.</p>
