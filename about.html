    <div class="description">
      <p>In 2011 I was diagnosed with celiac disease. As a consequence I had to closely examine all ingredients I used for cooking. At the very beginning I had to thoroughly read the labels of <strong>all food</strong> and drinks we bought. A simple shopping became a 4 hours long exercise, where I picked up a product, read the label, googled to understand some of its ingredients, only to then disappointedly put it back to the shelf knowing I can't have it anymore. Then I searched for an alternative product, repeat the reading and choosing which one shall I try. The whole exercise resulted in no more than 10-15 items in the basket. I realized that gluten was everywhere. I have found it even in the least anticipated places, like in some spices or pickles which I used to ate on a daily basis. This was terrifying. I thought we are not going to be able to cook more than just a few type of dishes. Sometimes I cried due to the despair.</p>

      <p>Back in 2011, in Hungary the selection of gluten free products wasnâ€™t wide. Once I have managed to find a suitable alternative ingredient, I started experimentation. With patience and persistence I have increased the number of dishes I was able to cook and now, a good few years later there are only a fraction of dishes what I still cannot cook gluten free. Right from the start my husband told me not to cook separately a gluten free dish for myself and a non-gluten free for him, just one dish for both of us.</p>

      <p>I decided to write down my recipes and sometimes film the process too. This means anyone can cook with these instructions and there is now an ever growing list of dishes I can choose from. Recently I noticed that more and more of our friends and acquaintances got diagnosed with celiac disease or have gluten sensitivity. We felt we could help them by sharing our recipes which are the result of experimentations over the years. I think these are very helpful even though that both the selection of ingredients and the awareness is much wider nowadays both in Hungary and in the UK, where I live now. I hope that by sharing my tips and tricks helps to to make life whole without gluten for everyone.
